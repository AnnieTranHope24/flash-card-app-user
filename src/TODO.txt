Implement add deck and add card****
Demo version before user sign in****
Refactor the app and learn to link user to their own page****

Also want a functionality to add one card
to multiple decks --> cards collection???
--> create a new card and copy it over

If users add card without adding decks first --> create a default deck for them
User log in --> need to add card, add deck, import file
If user doesn't sign in, where data will be stored?
User log in --> HomePage --> display data of User
Set up the database and stuff
Redo the HomePage after signing in:
    * Page after signing in: has the data of that user
    * email of that user
    * Logout button

Add navbar and bottom bar

Bug when signing in with email and cannot put the data into the database
